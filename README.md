The idea is that doing any kind of task related to machine learning involves a whole lot of steps like cleaning a dataset, choosing a model, deciding what the right configurations of that model should be, deciding what the most relevant features are etc. The goal of this project is to automate all of that up to a point where all a data scientist would need to do is tell a machine to perform some task using a dataset and wait for it to learn how by itself.
